# Structure-Aware Canonical Correlation Analysis on Lie Manifolds

This repository contains the code for the paper- Structure-Aware Canonical Correlation Analysis on Lie Manifolds. It includes codes for 
1. Generating the data using MuJoCo simulations (GenerateData.py)
2. The code for performing intrinsic canonical correlation analysis (ICCA.jl)

The data generation is run using python.
To run the code, run: python3 ExperimentPy/GenerateData.py
with the arguments: 
n: number of testing data (1000 by default)
testTrials= number of trials to be run (used for running multiple experiments to find the average of improvement- 3 by default)
trainTestSplit: train test split (0.7 by default)
step: number of steps between initial state and future state (30 by default)

The ICCA algorithm is using julia.
The algorithm uses the data generated by the python/MuJoCo generated data.
The function is called "main" in the scripts directory using the functions in the src directory
To run this code run:
1. Julia in the ICCA.jl directory
2. Do activate . in pkg mode
3. use ICCA pkg by typing: using ICCA
4. run the functions by typing: using main.jl # ICCA
